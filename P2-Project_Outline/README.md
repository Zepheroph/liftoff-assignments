## Submission Instructions

### Overview
ProductPal will be our headline application. The goal of ProductPal is to create an application that can help both small and big suppliers, as well as individuals to keep track of inventory in a simple yet efficient manner so as to erase the excess paper usage while also streamlining the experiences that other applications might provide. In this day, where everyone is trying to find their side hustle, we want to make it simple to know what you have left. To do this, we want to build from the ground up an app that is user friendly, enough so that anyone could download it off of whichever app store they choose and get to work keeping track of what they have. We hope that you can get behind the need for an app such as ours, as not only will it help many people, but it will help us as developers to expand our skillsets and further our careers!
